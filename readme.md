## Another try on learning node
I've tried to learn node in the past, but slacked off, did not really like the syntax. it looks way complicated and I wanted to stick with frontend javascript i.e vue, angular, or react.

Recently I've been feeling adventurous and wanting to learn something new, new methods, new paradims and actually try digging deep to build some solid javascript knowledge.

I learn better by touching various sources and see how things learned are used - so using node is just seeing how javascript is used in different ways. 
- see other ways javascript is used 
- Experience usage of await/async or Promises
- Understand Http and API even better
- Experiment with Javascript, and tools more and better
- Just be a better developer or Engineer or Technical Lead
